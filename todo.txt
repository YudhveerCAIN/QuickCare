QuickCare – Authentication s Onboarding Module
Narrative
Who: As a Citizen or Admin user of QuickCare
What: I want a secure and user-friendly onboarding system with flexible authentication options.
Why: So that I can easily access the platform, ensure data security, and seamlessly transition into role-specific dashboards.

Scope
•	Allow citizens to register with email and OTP verification.
•	Enable secure JWT-based login for all users.
•	Provide role-based access (Citizen vs. Admin).
•	Support password reset via email.
•	Allow users to manage and update profile details.
•	Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and compliant with data privacy standards.
•	Enable onboarding completion within ≤5 minutes.

Define Completion
•	95% of new users can register successfully on first attempt.
•	Email-based OTP verification functional and secure.
•	Login/authentication response time ≤2 seconds.
•	User roles (Citizen/Admin) enforced at all endpoints.
•	Password reset fully functional with encrypted storage.
•	Profile update functionality tested and reliable.
•	Security audits confirm no sensitive data stored in plain text.

Summary
 
Enable QuickCare users to securely register, log in, and onboard into the platform with minimal effort and maximum security. Provides smooth authentication, password
recovery, and role-based access to core features.

Benefit Hypothesis
By providing a fast, secure, and user-friendly authentication and onboarding module,
QuickCare ensures strong adoption, builds trust with users, and prevents unauthorized access. Citizens can quickly begin reporting issues, while admins can manage civic resolutions effectively.

Description
This module handles the authentication and onboarding of QuickCare users:
•	Registration: Citizens register with email and OTP verification.
•	Authentication: JWT tokens issued for login sessions, ensuring secure access.
•	Role Management: Default role is Citizen; Admin assigned by project sponsor.
•	Profile Management: Users can update name, contact info, and profile picture.
•	Password Reset: Secure reset link sent to registered email.
•	Security: Passwords hashed (bcrypt), sensitive data encrypted in database.
•	Performance: Authentication requests completed in ≤2 seconds.

Acceptance Criteria
•	Citizens can successfully register with email + OTP verification.
•	Admin roles can be created and assigned only by authorized personnel.
•	JWT tokens used for all authenticated API calls.
•	Users can update their profile and see changes immediately.
•	Password reset flow works end-to-end with no plain-text password storage.
•	Login sessions automatically expire after a set duration (e.g., 24 hours).
•	Security tests confirm compliance with encryption and data privacy standards.
